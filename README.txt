# Interdisciplinary SASS

This is my book about how I write SASS code. I wrote it for people
who want to get more into writing large, scalable webapps or websites.

This book is available for free, neither do I not intend to make any profits with it
nor will I accept donations, it is truly and solely meant for the purpose of sharing my findings.

I won't and will never say that I've found a perfect solution. But at least I can share
what has worked best for me so far and hope that others, who struggle the same as I did,
might find some answers to questions in this book.
