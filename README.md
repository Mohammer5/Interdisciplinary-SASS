# Book: Interdisciplinary SASS

This book is available for free, neither do I not intend to make any profits
with it nor will I accept donations, it is truly and solely meant for the
purpose of sharing my findings.

I won't and will never say that I've found a perfect solution. But at least I
can share what has worked best for me so far and hope that others, who struggle
the same as I did, might find some answers to questions in this book.

If you find a mistake, a better wording or a bug in one of the code examples,
please feel free to either create an issue or submit a pull request.
